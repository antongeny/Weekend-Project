(9/1 WEEK 2)
Weekend Homework:
This week is all about manipulating the dom, so we're gonna have a bit of homework focused on using a mix of dom selection and events to interact with our sites. There's 2 main options for this - feel free to either pick one of the below options or do all of them:
Take the site you created last weekend and add interactivity to it
Requirements:
[x] Add a button to your page
[x] Add a click listener to your button
[x] On click, restyle another element on your page in some way
ex: Change the color of some text on your site
Create a mini Cookie-Clicker replica
Requirements:
[] Create an empty webpage (html, css, + javascript)
[] Add two items to the HTML:
[] A line of text with the number "0" in it
[] An image or button
[] Add interactivity
[] Every 2 seconds, the counter goes up by 1
[] On click of the image or button, the counter on the page goes up by 1

Weekend Homework:
Below is an open ended project to complete over the weekend that should run through a lot of the big topics we covered this week. While this project isn't mandatory, it'll go a long way in helping you refine your understanding and they'll help give us a good idea of where you all are at with the content.
[ ] Create an HTML site (can be about any topic) that has the following elements (at least)
[ ] h1 tag
[ ] p tag
[ ] a tag
[ ] button tag
[ ] img tag
[ ] Add CSS styles to your HTML site
[ ] Set a background color
[ ] Use Flexbox
[ ] Extra Credit: Make your button change colors on hover
[ ] Push your code up to a Github repo
Please turn in the project even if you don't finish it that way we can get an idea of where you're at and help patch up any misunderstandings
