Weekend Homework:
Below is an open ended project to complete over the weekend that should run through a lot of the big topics we covered this week. While this project isn't mandatory, it'll go a long way in helping you refine your understanding and they'll help give us a good idea of where you all are at with the content.
[ ] Create an HTML site (can be about any topic) that has the following elements (at least)
[ ] h1 tag
[ ] p tag
[ ] a tag
[ ] button tag
[ ] img tag
[ ] Add CSS styles to your HTML site
[ ] Set a background color
[ ] Use Flexbox
[ ] Extra Credit: Make your button change colors on hover
[ ] Push your code up to a Github repo
Please turn in the project even if you don't finish it that way we can get an idea of where you're at and help patch up any misunderstandings
